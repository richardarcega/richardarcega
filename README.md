# ðŸ‘‹ Hello.

Hi, I'm Richard Arcega. I'm a software engineer.
Iâ€™ve spent the past 10+ years working across different areas of software development; front-end development, back-end development, to everywhere in between. 
I love making things, collaborating, and solving interesting problems.
Let's build something awesome together. 
If you have any questions, feedback, or just want to say hello, drop me a line.
